- [x] Control pre-game screen with `!binder` and `!freeplay` commands.
- [ ] Add response messages to improve interaction with Twitch Chat.
### Phase 2
These are the next 'nice-to-have' features, once all of the phase 1 tasks are completed and tested to function well.

- [ ] Control mod modules directly.
- [ ] *'Democracy / Anarchy' and or other moderation control?*
- [ ] *Command limiting? (depending on popularity of streams)*
